# Liver-Segmentation App

This is the base files for our web-app. 

- The intention is to allow Banana Leaf Development to use [OHIF Viewer](https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers), but also have the freedom to implement a login system and make our own changes to the UI/UX.


Current Progress

- We've embedded the DICOM Viewer
- The configuration file (client.js) is prepped for integration of extensions, which will help with the implementation of the mask interface, as well as UI/UX changes.

To do:

- Implement Login system
- Implement Mask interface
- Work on UI/UX
