# This is where we're keeping public website files

Current Content:
- index.html
-- creates basic web components
- 404.html
- client.js
-- primarily responsible for configuration and setup of the embedded dicom viewer

To do in future:
- Might copy linked js script here for editing
- Might include files for styling and ui/ux
- login page
